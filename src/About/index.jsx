                            My name is Victor Freire Oliveira and I am a creative Software Engineer from Macei√≥, AL - Brazil. My focus is frontend development, which means I build digital products that users see and interact with. Since I found out how fun coding can be, I started developing my skills and working on different personal projects and doing freelance services.

                            My experience started back in high school, learning HTML and CSS for fun, creating my own websites about whatever subject I enjoyed (old HotDog and Dreamweaver). The following years I kept developing skills in different areas, including Graphic Design and digital art. Nowadays, I make use of all those skills to bring solution to people through technology, keeping curious and thirsty for learning new things and sharing my ideas.
